# Assembly Projects

This repository contains a collection of assembly language projects that cover various concepts such as loops, arrays, input validation, and mathematical operations. Below is an overview of each project.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Project 1
- **Description**: This project receives three numbers from the user and checks if they are in descending order (from highest to lowest). The program then calculates the sum and difference of these numbers in various orders, displaying the results along with the corresponding equations. The project concludes by printing a goodbye message.
- **Key Concepts**: Input validation, arithmetic operations, conditional logic, output formatting.

### 2. Project 3
- **Description**: This project prints the highest and lowest numbers received, the sum of all numbers, the total count of numbers, and the average (rounded). It accomplishes this by using a loop/accumulator to gather user input, verify the input is within a specified range, compare it to existing minimum and maximum values, add it to the sum, and increment the count. The process continues until a positive number is received, after which the relevant statistics are printed.
- **Key Concepts**: Loops, input validation, accumulation, comparison operations, output formatting.

### 3. Project 4
- **Description**: This project prompts the user to enter a number and then displays that many prime numbers, starting from 2. The program ensures that each prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself using nested loops. After displaying the prime numbers, a final message is printed, and the program ends.
- **Key Concepts**: Nested loops, prime number calculation, output formatting.

### 4. Project 5 - Arrays, Addressing, and Stack-Passed Parameters
- **Description**: This project generates a randomized array of a size determined by a constant (`ARRAY_SIZE`) and within a specified range (`HI` and `LO`). The array is then sorted from least to greatest. After sorting, the program counts the occurrence of each number in the array. The arrays are printed using a procedure, and the median of the sorted list is displayed at the end.
- **Key Concepts**: Arrays, sorting algorithms, loops, counting occurrences, procedures, stack-passed parameters.

### 5. Project 6
- **Description**: This project takes 10 values from the user, which can be positive or negative. The program checks each input to ensure it isn't too large and doesn't contain letters or symbols. This validation is done by converting the input into a string and comparing the ASCII values to confirm they are digits or the `+` or `-` symbols. Once validated, the values are stored. The project also attempts to calculate the sum of the values.
- **Key Concepts**: Input validation, ASCII value comparison, string manipulation, summation, debugging.
